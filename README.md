# hledger-diff

hledger-diff is a simple tool to compare two journal files as used with
[hledger](http://hledger.org/).  It looks at the transactions of a single
account and prints out the transactions which are in one journal file but not
in the other.  This is particularly useful for reconciling existing journals
with bank statements.

## Installation

```
cabal install hledger-diff
```

## Usage example

```
